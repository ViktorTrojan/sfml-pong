# Zig SFML Pong

### A little test for my SFML zig wrapper

I made this to test my SFML zig wrapper you can find [here](https://github.com/Guigui220D/sfml-wrapper) in "real" conditions. I wanted to see if what I implemented in the binding was enough to make a simple game.

The game has sound, and textures. I will maybe add some other things in the future, like networking, depending on what I put in the sfml wrapper.

This project doesn't show how to organize a game or code properly using Zig. It also doesn't follow the best practices for programming.
